8.370.1x: Foundations of quantum and classical computing â€“ quantum mechanics, reversible computation, and quantum measurement

In this 8.370.1x course module covers:

Subunit 1:      quantum and classical computing fundamentals, including the history and development of quantum computation, and classical computation and reversibility

Subunit 2:      qubits and tensor products in quantum mechanics, spanning from states used to represent quantum information, to the formalism of tensor products, for describing how multiple states are put together, and unitary transforms, which describe state evolution

Subunit 3:      quantum measurement and quantum weirdness, presenting the formalism for measuring quantum states, and the strange behaviors obtained from such measurements, due to quantum entanglement
